We used in this work world bank's international debt data to analyze international debt. The dataset contains countries name, countries code, indicator_name which specifies the reason of taking the debt, 
indicator_code which symbolizes the category of these debts, and the amount of debt in USD. 

We are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?


/****** Initial look at the table:  */
SELECT * FROM international_debt LIMIT 10;
/*** The columns of the international_debt table are: country_name, country_code, indicator_name, indicator_code and	debt*/


/****** How many countries are in the table*/
SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT country_name ) AS total_distinct_countries 
FROM international_debt;
/*** 124 unique countries */


/****** Total amount of debt owed by countries */
SELECT ROUND(SUM(debt), 2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt; 
/***  The global debt reached  $307 trillion  ($3079734487675.80) */


/****** Country with the highest debt */
SELECT 
    country_name, 
    SUM(debt) AS total_debt

ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;
/*** China is the country with the highest debt with total debt of $285793494734.200001568  */


/****** Country with the lowest debt */
